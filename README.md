## SQL Set-Up Instructions

## Run Instructions
Remember to set-up your Run Configuration and Debug Configuration, and to launch things in the following order:
1. Start your MySQL Server (in this implementation, we used xampp)
2. In the root folder, edit the `config.txt` file to contain the desired IP address of the server and the desired port with a space as a delimiter. So, if your desired IP is 192.168.0.82 and your desired port is 8300, the file contents would be `192.168.0.82 8300`. Be sure to save once you're done editing.
3. Run main class in GameGUI (or launch uno.bat in the `batFiles` folder).
