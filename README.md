## Run Instructions
Remember to set-up your Run Configuration and Debug Configuration, and to launch things in the following order:
1. Start your MySQL Server (in this implementation, we used xampp)
   - We also assume that you have a `student_space` table and appropriate **student** account as defined in our **db.properties** file.
